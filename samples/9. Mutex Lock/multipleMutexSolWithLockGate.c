//  main.cpp
//  Threads with multiple mutex
//	I also add a "lock gate" so that all my threads actually start running 
//	and doing work at about the same time.
//
//	One thing to keep in mind is that pthread_create(), although much faster than
//	fork() is still considerably slower than a regular computation statement.  Once
//	a thread has been created, it starts executing the code of its function.  This 
//	means that if you create several threads, by the time the last thread has been
//	created, the first one may already have executed millions of statements.  Sometimes
//	we don't care.  Other times, we would like all our threads to really syart working
//	around the same time (this is often the case in simulation applications).  So we need
//	a mechanism to stop a thread and restart it fast.  

//	Mutex locks let us do that. The idea is to assign a mutex lock to each thread 
//	(it's convenient for us to store that lock in the thread's threadInfo struct). 
//	We are going to "pre-lock" the mutex, so that the first time the thread tries to
//	acquire its own lock, it will block, and will only resume execution when another
//	thread releases the lock. 
//
//	As usual with my code samples that come in series, all the new stuff in the
//	source file is always preceded by a comment line //new
