//===================================================================================
//	This program demonstrates how to use a lock file to establish primitive
//	Communication betweeen two or more processes.
//
//	This demo works with a hard-coded file path for the lock file.  A typical
//	location for lock files on a Linux system would be in the /tmp folder.
//
//	A process running this code will attempt to "acquire" the lock file.
//		If it can, then it will do its business, and eventually release
//			the lock, then terminate.
//		If it cannot acquire the lock, this means that another process holds
//			the lock. It will therefore wait for some time, and try again.
//			It will repeat doing so until either it can finally acquire the
//			lock or it has tried a set number of times, in which case it will
//			throw its figurative hands up and terminate.
//	Note that:
//		1. This program makes no attempt at implementing a useful task. Its
//			sole purpose is to demonstrate the lock file mechanism.
//		2. The idea here is to control the access to a shared resource.  The
//			process that acquired the lock gained the right to access the
//			shared resource.
//		3. In a more useful application, the process would not have to
//			terminate after releasng the lock.  It could return to its
//			calculations, to try to acquire the lock again.
//		4. Think of the lock as a way for one process to send a signal to the
//			other processes.  It is really just a kind of trigger, but of course
//			this requires the other processes to come checking the lock
//			regularly.
//
//	This program takes 2 optional arguments.  Assuming it was built as "prog"
//		./lock		uses the default values:	try up to 5 times to acquire the lock,
//					  and sleep 6 seconds between attempts
//		./lock 3	specifies the number of attempts (3 times) and uses the default
//					  sleep time between attemps (6 seconds)
//		./lock 3 8  specifies the number of attempts (3 times) and the sleep
//					  time between attempts (8 seconds)
//
//	You need to lauch the program at least twice from the terminal.  Each time
//	(maybe except the last) you need to launch the program "in the background"
//	using the umpersand & suffix, so that you regain control in the terminal, e.g.:
/*

./lock &
./lock 3 10 &
./lock 6 3

or, to get some failure

./lock &
./lock 3 10 &
./lock 4 2

//	This is easy if they run the same code, but will require a bit more effort

//	In any case, you should use a fairly "unique" name.  Otherwise, unrelated,
