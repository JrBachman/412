//	This program demonstrates the use of file locking routines for interprocess
//	communication.
//
//	The only difference with the previous version is that in this sample,
//	we use the lockf system call to set and remove the advisory lock.
//
//	lockf is simpler, but also a lot less flexible than fcntl.  The lock is
//	applied, starting from the current location, for a given number of bytes
//
