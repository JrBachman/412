//===================================================================================
//	This program builds on the previous "Lock File" sample, but, now that
//	we understand how lock files work, we actually access a shared resource
//
//	In this case, the shared resource is an output text files.  The first
//	process to gain access creates the text files and writes some data before
//	closing the file and releasing the lock.  All processes that subsequently
//	gain access open the shared file in "append" mode, so that their output
//	is appended to the file rather then overwriting ealier output.
//
//	In this version, I hard-coded the arguments from the "Lock File 1" sample:
//	The number of tries  and sleep time between tries are set, so as not to
//	take the focus from the main point of this sample (the use of the resource).
//
//	The process needs only to be launched once, as it forks multiple times
//	to create child processes with which to share access to the resource.
//	The only argument is the path to the output data file.
//	Contrary to the lock file, which typically goes to the /tmp folder, the
//	output file should be somewhere in the user's folder, for example:
//
//		./lock  ./output.txt
