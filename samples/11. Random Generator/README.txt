Two little programs that show you how to generate random numbers in C++


	oldStyleGenerator.cpp is just as it says:  Old-style code.
		This is the code that you are going to run into online and on the job,
		99% of the time.  And it's exactly what you wan to want to avoid, because
		it's terrible, as explained in the comments.
		At least, when you encounter it, you will recognize it.
		
	modernGenerator.cpp is the new, correct way of doing it.  It's actually not
		any more complex, but most C++ programmers are stuck with old C++99 at best,
		because this is what gets taught.
		Please use that one.
