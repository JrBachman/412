//	This is a revised version of process_fork_exec_3.c in this series.  It demonstrates 
//	a very common mistake that students make every semester in fork-exec assignments,
//	and again later in the semester in threading assignments.
//
//	Look first at the code and see if you can figure out what is wrong and why.
//	Then build the code and run it to verify.
//	Really, make the effort to look at the code first, because when you run it the
//	problem is obvious and you can kid yourself that "oh sure, I would have seen it 
//	if I had bothered to look at the code first."
//
//	As before, first build the executable for the 2 child programs
//		gcc -Wall sum.c -o sum
//		gcc -Wall max.c -o max 
//	and then build and execute this program.

	//-----------------------------
	//	I learned something today.  In retrospect it sort of makes sense.  When I 
	//	made the call the rand() inside the "if (p == 0)" block, I found that all my
	//	children processes where were running the same executable with the same list of 
	//	arguments.  This is because they were all working with a random generator
	//	that had been seeded at the same time, and therefore, they were pulling out
	//	identical lists of pseudo-random values.  The lesson of this is:  I need
	//	to generate my random list of arguments here, in the parent process, so that
	//	the children end up with different lists.

	//	executable they are going to run and their list of arguments

		//	I could do my random generation and allocation of the array to store all
		//	the arguments, but I would have to free that array afterwards.  It is much simpler
		//	to pull a random number of random values from the generator, so that the different
		//	children are now working with different sequences
		int shift = rand() % 10000;
