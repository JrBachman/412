//======================================================================================
//	This sample is fairly similar to that of process_fork_exec_2.c except for the
//	fact that we use a loop to create our child processes.
//
//	Again, this program can be built in two different versions by setting the value
//	of the WAIT_VERSION to one of the following four values:
//		o WAIT_FIXED_ORDER_CREATION:	the parent process waits for the children
//			processes to terminate, and it does so in the order in which it created them.
//		o WAIT_FIXED_ORDER_REVERSE:	the parent process waits for the children
//			processes to terminate, and it does so in the reverse of the order in 
//			which it created them.
//		o WAIT_NO_ORDER:	the parent process wait for its children to terminate, but
//			does not care in which order they terminate, as long as they all 
//			terminate.
//		o CHECK_NO_WAIT:	the parent process checks if its children terminated, in no
//			specific order, but does so with a non-blocking call (so that it can do
//			other interesting things while its children are running).  It still
//			waits until all children have terminated to terminate its own execution.
//
//	What about other possible configurations/versions that you may find more 
//	interesting?  Yes, what about them?  Add to this code, try them, and report
//	on the forums.
//
//	Note that I don't test for any abnormal termination of the child processes.  This
//	is a "fair weather" demo.  If you need to handle special cases of a child process
//	crashing without returning a value, you will need to look carefully at the 
//	documentation of waitpid
//
//	So, first build the executable for the 2 child programs
//		gcc child1.c -p child1
//		gcc child2.c -p child2
//	and then build and execute this program.

	//	children processes where were running the same executable with the same list of 
	//	arguments.  This is because they were all working with a random generator
	//	that had been seeded at the same time, and therefore, they were pulling out
	//	identical lists of pseudo-random values.  The lesson of this is:  I need
	//	to generate my random list of arguments here, in the parent process, so that
	//	the children end up with different lists.
